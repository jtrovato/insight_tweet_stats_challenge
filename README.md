# insight_tweet_stats_challenge
Joe Trovato

This challenge was completed as a part of insight data engineering's coding challenge. The challenge consists of reading tweets froma text files and completing some basic statistics on the "stream" of tweets. The code contained in this repo was written to be scaled to much larger tweet inputs than the example tweets.txt. For example, tweets are parsed in bundles as oppossed to all at once to avoid memory issues when loading large datasets.
